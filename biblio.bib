abstract = {Cyber security is attracting worldwide attention. With attacks being more and more common and often successful, no one is spared today. Threat modeling is proposed as a solution for secure application development and system security evaluations. Its aim is to be more proactive and make it more difficult for attackers to accomplish their malicious intents. However, threat modeling is a domain that lacks common ground. What is threat modeling, and what is the state-of-the-art work in this field? To answer these questions, this article presents a review of threat modeling based on systematic queries in four leading scientific databases. This is the first systematic literature review on threat modeling to the best of our knowledge. 176 articles were assessed, and 54 of them were selected for further analysis. We identified three separate clusters: (1) articles making a contribution to threat modeling, e.g., introducing a new method, (2) articles using an existing threat modeling approach, and (3) introductory articles presenting work related to the threat modeling process. The three clusters were analyzed in terms of a set of criteria, for instance: Is the threat modeling approach graphical or formal? Is it focused on a specific attack type and application? Is the contribution validated empirically or theoretically? We observe from the results that, most threat modeling work remains to be done manually, and there is limited assurance of their validations. The results can be used for researchers and practitioners who want to know the state-of-the-art threat modeling methods, and future research directions are discussed.}

abstract = {Summary Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks represent one of the most critical security challenges facing network operators. Software-defined networking (SDN) permits fast reactions to such threats by dynamically enforcing simple forwarding/blocking rules as countermeasures. However, the centralization of the control plane requires that the SDN controller, besides network management operations, should also collect information to identify and mitigate the security menaces. A major drawback of this approach is that it may overload the controller and the control channel. On the other hand, stateful SDN represents a new concept, developed to improve reactivity and offload the controller by delegating local treatments to the switches. In this article, we embrace this paradigm to protect end-hosts from DDoS attacks. We propose StateSec, a novel approach based on in-switch processing capabilities to detect and mitigate flooding threats. StateSec monitors packets matching configurable traffic features without resorting to the controller. By feeding an entropy-based detection algorithm with such monitoring features, it detects and mitigates several threats such as (D)DoS with high accuracy. We implemented StateSec in an SDN platform comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches. We show that StateSec is far more efficient: It achieves very accurate detection levels, reducing at the same time the control plane overhead. We have also evaluated the memory footprint of StateSec for a possible use in production. Finally, we deployed StateSec over a real network to tune its parameters and assess its suitability to real-world deployments.},
